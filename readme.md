# Introduction to Communication Theory
This repository provides lab material using MATLAB for an undergraduate 
class in wireless communications. Eventually, I will add lab material using software defined radios (SDRs).
The material in this repository are used for:

*EE-UY 3404 Fundamentals of Communication Theory*, an undergraduate level class at NYU Tandon.

Anyone is free to use and copy this material (at their own risk!). 
But, please cite the material if you use the material in your own class.

## Pre-requisites
The class assumes undergraduate probability (stochastic processes) and undergruate signals and systems.
Familiarity with MATLAB or equivalent language is preferred.

## Feedback
Any feedback is welcome. If you find errors, have ideas for improvements, 
or want to voice any other thoughts, [create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/)
and we will try to get to it. Even better, fork the repository, make the changes yourself and 
[create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) and we will try to merge it in.

## Sequence
We will add to this section as the class progresses.

* Unit 1.  Passband modulation
    * MATLAB exercise:  [Simulating up- and down-conversion](./unit01_passband/lab_passband_partial.m)
* Unit 2.  Amplitude modulation
* Unit 3.  Frequency modlation
* Unit 4.  Superheterodyne receivers
* Unit 5.  Random variables
